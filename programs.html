        <p>In an effort to inform the community about adult education and literacy services throughout the state, the Adult Education Initiatives Office has worked with partners to put together a list of programs by county. Adult education and literacy programs play an integral role in communities. Programs work to strengthen the skills of individuals so they can reach their personal, academic, and career goals, and more effectively contribute to their families and the community around them. By utilizing adult education programs, whole families and communities are strengthened.</p>
        <p>Programs offer a variety of services including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Adult basic and secondary education to assist adult learners in attaining high school equivalency credentials,</li>
          <li>English language acquisition for non-native English speaking adult learners to assist in reaching academic goals and workplace preparation</li>
          <li>Family literacy education which enables family members to support their childrenâ€™s learning needs</li>
          <li>Civics education</li>
        </ol>
