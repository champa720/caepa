When I was in graduate school a friend of mine encouraged me to teach a class at Right to Read Adult Education Center. Before visiting the school, I thought “adult education” was a song by Hall & Oates, but by the end of one semester I had fallen in love with adult learners, many of whom I’m lucky to still call friends.

I taught ESL levels 3 and 4 for Right to Read for two years while teaching composition classes at the collegiate level.

When the opportunity to become the director of our program presented itself, I was excited about the possibility of impacting learners and educators on a larger scale but nervous about leaving the classroom. My co-workers and other colleagues around the state have helped me settle into this role and sometimes my staff even lets me teach a class with them.

I feel extremely fortunate to work with such amazing people both in our program and other adult education programs in Colorado. We are a bizarre and wonderful group united in our passion to empower adults through education. This business of literacy instruction is not for the faint of heart, and I am so blessed to do work I deeply believe in with and for people who never cease to surprise and inspire me.
