2015,,TRUE,Rebecca Booterbaugh,reschmecka@hotmail.com,303-938-0456,"Rebecca is a highly skilled adult educator. Besides being a outstanding ESL, ABE, and ASE instructor, Rebecca has demonstrated a commitment to adult education with a wonderful mix of passion and enthusiasm with down-to-earth common sense.  At St. Vrain Community Adult Education, she has taken on duties as ESL Program Coordinator, providing support and direction for teachers, and support for the program's administration as well.

In Longmont, 25% of households speak a first language other than English and more than half of K-12 student population receive free or reduced lunch.  11% of our families are living below the poverty level.  The need for comprehensive adult education services in Longmont, to help break the cycle of poverty is very great.  We need to expand our program to include ABE and ASE and Rebecca Booterbaugh will be instrumental in that expansion.  CAEPA Rendezvous is an excellent opportunity for her to network with other programs and practioners to determine what's possible for us. 

We simply don't have the budget to send our teachers to CAEPA, but Rebecca will also be able to share what she learns at CAEPA with our ESL staff, to aid in their professional development.  Without the scholarship, it will be difficult for her to attend.",,,
